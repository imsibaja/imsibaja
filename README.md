### What I'm up to 

As a current Master of Environmental Data Science (MEDS) student at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management, I am honing my talents in analysis and data manipulation. I hope to utilize my analytical toolkit to develop data-driven solutions that measure and mediate human impacts on the natural environments of Southern California. Before the Bren School, I was a professional terrestrial ecologist, speniding seasons about the diverse ecosystems of Southern California. Now, I would like to transition to marine ecology, with my first project in this area above ^🔭.
