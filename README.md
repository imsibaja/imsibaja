### What I'm up to 

As a recent Master of Environmental Data Science (MEDS) grad student at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management, I am looking to apply my talents in analysis and data manipulation. I hope to utilize my analytical toolkit to develop data-driven solutions that measure and mediate human impacts on the natural environments of Southern California. Before the Bren School, I was a professional terrestrial ecologist, spending seasons about the diverse ecosystems of Southern California. Now, I would like to transition to marine ecology, with my first project in this area above ^🔭.
